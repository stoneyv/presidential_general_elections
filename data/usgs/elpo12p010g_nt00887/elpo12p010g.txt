      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: 
          The county boundaries file was used as a starting point.  Because Alaska reports results by State legislative 
          district, county boundaries for Alaska were deleted and Alaska legislative district boundaries were added to 
          the file.  Kalawao County and Maui County, HI were merged into a single area.  The State election results 
          data sets were downloaded and joined to the boundaries file using the FIPS attribute.

          The Missouri Secretary of State reported Jackson County and Kansas City voting totals separately; the votes 
          for both entities were combined into Jackson County.  

          In New York, both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama appeared on the ballot under more than one party; votes were 
          totaled based on the candidate, not the political party.  

          Oklahoma only reported votes for the Republican and Democratic parties; votes were assigned to the 
          appropriate candidate.  

          Rhode Island and Massachusetts report results by towns and cities.  City and town results were aggregated 
          into the county in which the city or town is located.  The vote total for cities and towns in Rhode Island 
          does not match the State total, because overseas military and civilians residing overseas are issued ballots 
          that contain only federal offices; these votes are therefore not assigned to a particular city or town and 
          are not included in this data set. 

          Kalawao County and Maui County, Hawaii results are reported together.

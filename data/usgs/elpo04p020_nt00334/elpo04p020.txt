  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set portrays election results, by counties for 49 States and 
      by election districts for Alaska, for the 2004 Presidential general 
      election.  Reported for each county are the popular vote count for the 
      Democratic Party candidate, the Republican Party candidate, and all other 
      votes.  Also reported are the percentage of the vote cast for each party’s 
      candidate, based on the total number of valid votes cast.  Over votes 
      (ballots which contained votes for more than one candidate) and under 
      votes (ballots which contained votes for no candidate) are not included in 
      the total number of votes reported.  For details particular to each State, 
      see the Process Steps.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      The National Atlas of the United States assumes no responsibility for the 
      use of these data.
